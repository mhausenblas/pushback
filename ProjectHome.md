With pushback we aim at turning the current 'read-only' Semantic Web into a read/write Semantic Web. Most of the editable data on the Web comes from Web 2.0 sources (such as flickr, Twitter, etc.) that are offering write-APIs to manipulate the data. Often, this data is being exposed as RDF through RDF wrapper, which know the read-API of the Web 2.0 source. In a Web of Data browser, such as Tabulator, RDF data is potentially pulled together from many different data sources, where often an HTML form to manipulate the data is known. In pushback, we define a vocabulary and a process to create so called RDForms (HTML form + RDF data) and write back changes to the Web 2.0 sources via an RDF wrapper.
