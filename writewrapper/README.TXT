This is the readme file from the google calendar demo.
In order to use it, you must have a Google account and some events in the Google calendar.
Export your Google calendar to an ics file.
If you want to modify an event from your calendar, open the ics file(it's a text file) and write down the event's ID.
You should write that ID in the CalendarRDForm.html.
Open CalendarRDForm.html in you web bowser, write the ID of the event in the ID box and something in the title box.
Leave the startime, endtime, location like they are.
The demo is for only modifying the title/summary.
Then click update. You should be prompted to log to google. 
If everything goes write you should see:

Old title: Your old title
New title: Your new title.

If it doesn't work contact me at oana.ureche@deri.org.
